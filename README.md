As published in this tweet: https://twitter.com/simonhhess/status/1590366182699577344

I am planning to publish the full lecture slidse with improved illustrations towarsd the end of the term. Any feedback on improving code or appearance of these visualizationsi is very welcome. Either via pull requets or just as an email.

The slides are free to use, but of course I am happy to get mentioned.

# So where are the relevant files?

In `metrics00-demo`

# Large file size

The files can get extremely large, because they store thousands of lines in vector graphic format. To reduce filesize you either reduce the number of intermediatea steps that are shown or use `dev="png"` to store them as raster files.
